# GEOG 495: Final Project

## Project Title: Washington State Libraries

## Project description:
The goal of this final project is to identify all the libraries that are available in Washington state, find which areas of Washington are the  libraries most populated in with a thematic map, and sort these maps by their type. There are a lot of libraries available, and according to the data, there are 639 libraries available with type descriptions classifying from “Academic libraries”, “Government Libraries”, “Public Libraries”,  and “Special Libraries”. Academic libraries classify from schools and colleges mainly for student usage, government libraries are county law libraries, public libraries are libraries available to the public and for public usage, and finally special libraries are classified as museums, medical buildings withholding information, and miscellaneous buildings. These libraries are all spread out across Washington state, and some are more populated than others. I would like to show the distance of one location to another as well as show which areas of Washington contain the most libraries through the thematic map and sorting. 

## Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?):
The main message I want to get across to the view/user is that libraries are available to you for usage in many different locations. Many of these authors share their stories or create fictional ones for entertainment as well as for knowledge and growth of the mind on different concepts. This project will showcase the different locations of these libraries, where they are mainly populated, and where they are least populated, and possible locations to go and explore locally all the new information that is awaiting to be seen and discovered.

## Main functions:
Using Geocoding capabilities that were taught in week 7 as well as web-based spatial analysis, mainly sorting by distance taught in week 8. These functions as well as a side-panel that includes detailed legend (library location count), asynchronous data loading while scrolling and/or while sorting data, and clickable check boxes that can aggregate the data and display different type of libraries (academic, government, public, special) on the map.

## Data source:

## Applied libraries (e.g., mapbox gl js) and Web Services (e.g., GitHub, basemap) in use
